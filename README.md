# Spectral-Analysis-Fitting-Experiment
#This project try to solve the problem of spectral analysis in 1D 1H NMR spectra, that is to determine the resonance
#frequencies and coupling constants of a given Spin System formulated as a nonlinear least square problem, which is solved
#by metaheuristics optimization techniques.
